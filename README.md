## üìä **Catalog Competitiveness Analysis Dashboard**

This repository contains the SQL queries and documentation for a dashboard that analyzes the competitiveness of a trading catalog across different categories. The dashboard provides insights into how well the selected catalog performs compared to other catalogs or suppliers in terms of pricing and model availability. This tool helps the Trading Director track key metrics and make strategic decisions to improve the catalog's performance.

---

### **Overview**

The dashboard is designed to provide comprehensive analytics on catalog performance, focusing on:
- **ABC Analysis**: Prioritization of models based on frequency and GMV (Gross Merchandise Value).
- **Category Performance**: Detailed breakdown by category, showing which categories are most competitive.
- **Price Comparison**: Identification of models where the selected catalog/supplier is not the lowest-priced option.

The dashboard is interactive, allowing users to filter data by catalog, top category, and other parameters. It also provides detailed reports with model details, prices, and rankings, enabling deeper analysis.
